<h1>Recursive DNS Server using Pihole</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project is a Pi-hole home lab built on Ubuntu Server Linux to provide network-wide DNS and ad blocking.The lab is upgraded into a recursive DNS server by installing Unbound and integrating it with Pi-hole using localhost port 5335, reducing reliance on third-party DNS providers. The environment demonstrates core IT fundamentals including Linux server setup, DNS configuration, and validation/testing using the Pi-hole admin interface.
